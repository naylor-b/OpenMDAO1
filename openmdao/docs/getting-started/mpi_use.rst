Using MPI in OpenMDAO
---------------------

There are currently two ways to use MPI in OpenMDAO.  The first way is
demonstrated in the `Distributed Adder Example`_ which involves using
OpenMDAO to build your own distributed components.  The second way is
demonstrated in the `Parallel Multi Point Example`_ which involves using
OpenMDAO to build a multi-point problem to analyze a single design at a number
of different conditions.
